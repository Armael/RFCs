# OCaml RFCs

This repository is for proposals to change the OCaml language
or the internals of its compiler. It currently has a single folder:

- rfcs

## RFCs

The rfcs folder is for accepted proposals for changes to the
language. Files should be created in this directory via pull requests,
and the merging of those pull requests should only happen once there
is consensus to accept the change in principle.

We'll adjust and adapt the process as we go, but as a starting point
RFCs should provide:

 - A high-level summary of the change
 - Motivation for the change
 - Technical details of the change
 - Drawbacks of the change and alternatives to the change
 - Unresolved questions

Then we can discuss the proposal in the comments of the pull request
and, once consensus is reached, either merge or close the pull
request.
