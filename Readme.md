# OCaml RFCs, notes and paper drafts

This repository is for work collaborating on the OCaml
type-checker. It is split into four folders:

 - rfcs
 - designs
 - research
 - notes

## RFCs

The rfcs folder is for accepted proposals for changes to the language
or (existing) type-checker. Files should be created in this directory
via pull requests, and the merging of those pull requests should only
happen once there is consensus to accept the change in principle.

We'll adjust and adapt the process as we go, but as a starting point
RFCs should provide:

 - A high-level summary of the change
 - Motivation for the change
 - Technical details of the change
 - Drawbacks of the change and alternatives to the change
 - Unresolved questions

Then we can discuss the proposal in the comments of the pull request
and, once consensus is reached, either merge or close the pull
request.

## Designs

The designs folder is intended for design documents related to the
"high road" type-checker. Such documents can be added and evolved via
pull request to enable people to easily collaborate and discuss these
designs.

Merging a document to this directory has no particular meaning so
people can make up their own minds about when to merge such pull
requests.

## Research

The research folder is for draft papers and other research materials
(e.g. formalisations) related to the "high road" type-checker. As with
the designs directory, the aim of this folder is to aid collaboration
and people should feel free to use the folder as they see fit.

## Notes

The notes folder is for meeting minutes, reports, and other
administrative notes related to working on the type-checker.
